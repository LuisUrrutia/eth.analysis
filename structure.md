# Directory Structure Overview

The structure of go-ethereum is basically divided into directories according to functional packages.

- **accounts** Implements high-level Ethereum account management
- **build** Scripts and configurations to build and generate packages of go-ethereum
- **cmd** Command line tools
  - **abidump** Try to interpret the ABI data (Trx data) using the 4bytes database (4byte.json)
  - **abigen** Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy to use, compile-time type-safe Go packages
  - **bootnode** Starts a node that only implements network discovery protocol
  - **checkpoint-admin** Tool to manage Checkpoint oracle (Smart contract that stores a trusted checkpoint for LES protocol)
  - **clef** Used to sign transactions and data. Eventual replacement for Geth's account management
  - **devp2p** Utility for low-level peer-to-peer debugging and protocol development purposes
  - **ethkey** Tool for working with Ethereum keyfiles
  - **evm** Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode
  - **faucet** Web app with the goal of distributing small amounts of Ether in private and test networks
  - **geth** The official command-line client for Ethereum
  - **p2psim**
  - **puppeth** Wizard to assemble and maintain private networks
  - **rlpdump** Pretty-printer for RLP data
  - **utils** Helper functions for commands
- **common** Contains various helpers functions
- **consensus** Different Ethereum consensus engines
- **console** JavaScript interpreted runtime environment to be attached to a running node
- **contracts** Solidity contracts and bindings. Just CheckpointOracle for now
- **core** Implements the Ethereum consensus protocol
- **crypto** Encryption and hashing algorithms
- **docs** Audits and post-mortems
- **eth** Implements the Ethereum protocol

- **miner** Implements Ethereum block creation and mining
- **mobile** Wrappers to support mobile platforms
- **node** Sets up multi-protocol Ethereum nodes
- **p2p** Implements the Ethereum p2p network protocols
- **params** Configurations, default and hardcoded params
- **rlp** Implements the RLP serialization format
- **rpc** Implements bi-directional JSON-RPC 2.0 on multiple transports
- **signer** TODO
  - **core**
  - **fourbyte**
